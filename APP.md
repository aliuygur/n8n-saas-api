## instol.cloud – Business Model, Pricing, and Policies

### Business Model

instol.cloud is a **managed hosting SaaS platform** that enables customers to deploy and run open-source applications (such as **n8n**) with just a few clicks — **without requiring DevOps or advanced software knowledge**.

Instead of dealing with servers, infrastructure, updates, and maintenance, customers can focus on using their applications, while instol.cloud handles:

* Application provisioning
* Hosting and infrastructure management
* Updates and operational reliability

The business operates on a **per-instance subscription model**.
Each hosted application instance is billed independently on a monthly basis.

---

### Pricing

* **Free Trial:**

  * 3-day free trial
  * No credit card required
  * Full access to the hosted application during the trial period

* **Paid Subscription:**

  * **$9.99 USD per month, per application instance**
  * Each additional instance is billed separately
  * Pricing is recurring and charged monthly

Example:
If a customer hosts 3 application instances, they are billed 3 × $9.99 per month.

---

### Billing Cycle

* Billing starts automatically once the free trial ends.
* Subscriptions renew monthly unless canceled by the customer.
* All prices are listed in USD and exclude applicable taxes unless otherwise stated.

---

### Cancellation Policy

* Customers can **cancel their subscription at any time** from their account dashboard.
* Cancellation takes effect at the **end of the current billing period**.
* After cancellation, the hosted application instance will be deactivated and removed according to platform retention rules.

---

### Refund Policy

* **Free trial period:** No payment is collected, so no refund is required.
* **Paid subscriptions:**

  * Payments are **non-refundable** once a billing period has started.
  * Partial refunds are not provided for unused time within a billing cycle.

This policy ensures transparent and predictable pricing while allowing customers to freely evaluate the service during the trial period.

---

If you want, I can also:

* Rewrite this in a **more legal / Terms of Service tone**
* Adapt it for **Paddle, Stripe, or Polar.sh compliance**
* Shorten it for a **landing page version**
* Create a **FAQ-style version** for customers

Just tell me 👍

---


Perfect — Paddle is basically asking you for **public, copy-paste-ready legal pages**.
Below are **clean, Paddle-compliant texts** you can publish directly on:

* `https://instol.cloud/terms`
* `https://instol.cloud/privacy`
* `https://instol.cloud/refund-policy`

You can also **merge Refund Policy into Terms**, but Paddle accepts it cleaner when separated.
